1 Introduction
The bidding card game ”Diamonds” is a strategic game where players aim to accumulate the
most diamonds through various actions, including bidding, collecting, and stealing diamonds.
Developing effective strategies in ”Diamonds” is crucial for success, as it involves predicting
opponents’ moves and optimizing one’s own actions.
This report explores the use of genetic algorithms (GenAl) in developing strategies for
”Diamonds.” Genetic algorithms are a powerful tool in optimization and strategy develop-
ment, mimicking the process of natural selection to evolve solutions to complex problems.
2 Problem Statement
The problem at hand is to develop robust strategies for playing ”Diamonds” that can adapt
to different opponents and game scenarios. Traditional methods of strategy development
may be limited in their ability to explore the vast space of possible moves and counter-moves
efficiently.
Genetic algorithms offer a promising approach to this problem by iteratively evolving
sets of strategies through simulated evolution. By encoding potential strategies into genes
and applying mechanisms such as crossover and mutation, GenAl can explore a wide range
of possibilities and converge towards effective solutions.
3 Teaching GenAl the Game
Before employing genetic algorithms to develop strategies for ”Diamonds,” it is necessary
to teach GenAl the rules and mechanics of the game. This involves representing the game
state, possible actions, and scoring mechanisms in a format that GenAl can understand and
manipulate.
One approach is to encode the game state as a set of variables representing the number
of diamonds held by each player, the contents of their personal supply, and the state of the
central diamond supply. Possible actions, such as bidding, collecting, and stealing, can be
encoded as operations that modify the game state.

4 Iterating upon Strategy
The process of evolving strategies using GenAl involves several key steps:
1. Initialization: Generate a population of candidate strategies, encoding them as indi-
viduals within a population of genomes.
2. Evaluation: Simulate games between strategies within the population and evaluate
their performance based on predefined metrics, such as the number of diamonds accu-
mulated.
3. Selection: Select individuals from the population for reproduction based on their
performance, favoring those with higher fitness.
4. Crossover and Mutation: Apply genetic operators such as crossover and mutation
to produce offspring with variations of the selected strategies.
5. Replacement: Replace the current population with the offspring to form the next
generation.
6. Termination: Repeat the process for a predetermined number of generations or until
a satisfactory solution is found.
By iteratively applying these steps, GenAl can evolve strategies that exhibit increasingly
effective gameplay in ”Diamonds.”
5 Analysis and Conclusion
The use of genetic algorithms for developing strategies in ”Diamonds” offers several ad-
vantages. It allows for the exploration of a vast solution space, adaptability to different
opponents and game scenarios, and the potential for discovering novel and innovative strate-
gies.
However, there are also limitations to consider, such as the computational complexity of
simulating games and the need for careful tuning of genetic algorithm parameters.
In conclusion, genetic algorithms show promise as a tool for developing strategies in
”Diamonds,” offering a systematic and adaptable approach to strategy optimization. Further
research and experimentation are needed to fully realize their potential in this domain.
